# Chess

React and Redux based Chess app.

I started this project for dive into [Flow](https://flowtype.org/).

Result: I think Flow is awesome, and want to use it ever since now. Just check how [beautiful it is](https://github.com/CAPSLOCKUSER/Chess/blob/master/src/types/ChessTypes.js).

## TODO:
- check for checkmate
- be able to make a castle move
- be able to make an `en passant` move

## Future plans:

- make it online multiplayer
- AWS lambda
- protobufjs (or other)
- progressive web app
